    <h2> Most Famous bridges </h2>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    Modern bridges are architectural constructions built to span physical obstacles to provide easy passage. Even though their function is simple and clear, the mere presence of these large man-made objects has transformed many of them into cultural or historic landmarks of great importance to the local population, nations or even entire world. Their versatility in function, structural form, and visual appeal have enabled them to become easily integrated into any environment, where they are hailed as integral parts of transportation infrastructure or even highly influential because of their notable engineering or design features.
</p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Most famous bridges in the world have managed to distinguish themselves by having various features that make them distinct among tens of thousands of notable bridges that are currently in use all over the world. Those features may be their size, visual appeal, use of brand new construction techniques, use of new construction material, historical or cultural importance, and many others.</p>
